+++ River: machine learning for streaming data in Python +++


 
<!--more-->



## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say

 


## Tools and Frameworks
 
**River: machine learning for streaming data in Python.** A [new preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04740v1.pdf) describes ``River``, a machine learning library for dynamic data streams and continual learning. It provides multiple state-of-the-art learning methods, data generators/transformers, performance metrics and evaluators for different stream learning problems. It is the result from the merger of the two most popular packages for stream learning in Python: ``Creme`` and ``scikit-multiflow``. ``River`` introduces a revamped architecture based on the lessons learnt from the seminal packages. ``River``â€™s ambition is to be the go-to library for doing machine learning on streaming data. Additionally, this open source package brings under the same umbrella a large community of practitioners and researchers. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/online-ml/river).
