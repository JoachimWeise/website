## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say

 


## Tools and Frameworks
 
**PyTorch Lightning 1.0: From 0–600k.** PyTorch Lightning is an open-source Python library that provides a high-level interface for the popular deep learning framework PyTorch. It is designed to create scalable deep learning models that can easily run on distributed hardware while keeping the models hardware agnostic. [PyTorch Lightning](http://pytorchlightning/) now reveals the stable [API](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) version 1.0.0, a new [website](http://pytorchlightning/), a collection of [tutorial videos](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/tutorials) and a sneak peek into our new native platform for training models at scale on the cloud.
