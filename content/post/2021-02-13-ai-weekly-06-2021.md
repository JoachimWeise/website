**ETA Phone Home: How Uber Engineers an Efficient Route.** This is not really news, but rather a chance find of an older [article by Uber](https://eng.uber.com/engineering-routing-engine/) on how they engineered efficient routes and calculated estimated time of arrival (ETA) up until 2015.

## Tutorials

**Data Science and ML Study Guides.** The twin brothers Shervine Amidi (Stanford) and Afshine Amidi (MIT) have compiled really nice study guides on [Data Science](https://www.mit.edu/~amidi/teaching/) and [Machine Learning](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/), based on their experience as teaching assistants in computer science classes. The material is delivered both through nice web tutorials as well as PDF cheat sheets.
