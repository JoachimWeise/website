### Luminosity vs radiant flux (aka apparent brightness)


Luminosity $$L$$ is an absolute measure of radiated electromagnetic power, or radiant power, emitted by a light-emitting object. In astronomy, luminosity is the total amount of electromagnetic energy emitted per unit of time by a star, galaxy, or other astronomical object. Luminosity is an intrinsic property of the object &mdash; it does not depend in any way on the location or motion of the observer. 

The IAU has defined a nominal solar luminosity of 3.846 × 10<sup>26</sup> W to promote publication of consistent and comparable values in units of the solar luminosity $$L_\odot$$. When not qualified, the term "luminosity" means *bolometric* luminosity, taking into account electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths.


Luminosity is sometimes referred to as the star’s *absolute* brightness. However, when we look at a star, we don't see its luminosity, but rather its *apparent* brightness &mdash; the amount of energy striking a unit area of some light-sensitive surface or device (e.g. CCD chip or human eye) per unit time. The apparanet brightness of a star is actually measured in terms of the radiant flux $$F$$ received from the star. Of course, the radiant flux received from an object depends on both its intrinsic luminosity and its distance from the observer. Imagine a star of luminosity $$L$$ surrounded by a huge spherical shell of radius $$r$$. Then, assuming that no light is absorbed during its journey out to the shell, the radiant flux, $$F$$, measured at distance $$r$$ is related to the star’s luminosity by

$$F = \frac{L}{4 \pi r^2} \; .$$  

The luminosity of the sun is $$L_\odot$$ = 3.846 × 10<sup>26</sup> W. At a distance of AU = 1.496<sup>11</sup> m, Earth receives a radiant flux or apparent brightness of $$F$$ = 1370 W/m<sup>2</sup>. That is, a solar panel with an area of 1 m<sup>2</sup> receives 1370 W of power from the Sun.



### Apparent Brightness and the Magnitude Scale

Apparent brightness is a measure, not of a star’s luminosity, but of the energy flux (energy per unit area per unit time) produced by the star, as seen from Earth. A star’s apparent brightness depends on our distance from the star.
