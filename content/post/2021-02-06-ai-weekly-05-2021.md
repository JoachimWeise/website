## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say

 


## Tools and Frameworks
 
**Introducing Lightning Flash — From Deep Learning Baseline To Research in a Flash.** Over the past year, [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorchlightning.ai/) has received an enthusiastic response from the community for decoupling research from boilerplate code, enabling seamless distributed training, logging, and reproducibility of deep learning research code. Now [Flash](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-flash) promises even further acceleration, offering a super quick way to get a Lightning baseline to benchmark experiments against, using proven backbones for common data patterns. Flash is comprised of a collection of Tasks. Flash Tasks are laser-focused objects designed to solve common problems, using state-of-the-art methods. Flash Tasks are designed to make Inference, Finetuning, and Training seamless.

**Full Stack Deep Learning - Spring 2021.** The [folks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/full-stack-deep-learning/) from [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/), most of them affiliated with the group of [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) at UC Berkeley, have just released their [spring 2021 course](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/) which starts with a 4-week review of DNN basics before spending 10 weeks on the ins and outs of MLOps. The course comes loaded with lecture videos, slides and labs. The earlier [2019 edition](https://fall2019.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) can also be found online.
