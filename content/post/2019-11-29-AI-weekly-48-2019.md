## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say




## Tools and Frameworks

**Introducing TF-GAN: A lightweight GAN library for TensorFlow 2.0.** The TensorFlow team has released some handy [code](https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tf-gan-a-lightweight-gan-library-for-tensorflow-2-0-36d767e1abae) for training GANs with TF 2.0, along with a [self-study GAN course](https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tf-gan-a-lightweight-gan-library-for-tensorflow-2-0-36d767e1abae) and tutorials [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/gan/blob/master/tensorflow_gan/examples/colab_notebooks/tfgan_on_tpus.ipynb#scrollTo=UUIJxquv6OHk) and [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/gan/blob/master/tensorflow_gan/examples/colab_notebooks/tfgan_tutorial.ipynb).






## Business News and Applications

**Global AI Survey: AI proves its worth, but few scale impact.** Most companies report measurable benefits from AI where it has been deployed; however, much work remains to scale impact, manage risks, and retrain the workforce. This new report from [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/global-ai-survey-ai-proves-its-worth-but-few-scale-impact?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_261) shows how a group of high performers is leading the way.



## Publications

**Deep Learning with PyTorch.** Manning and PyTorch are offering a free collection of excerpts from their upcoming book, [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/deep-learning-with-pytorch?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_261). It provides a detailed, hands-on introduction to building and training neural networks with PyTorch, a popular open source machine learning framework. 

## Tutorials

**Cost-benefit analysis in R.** This [tutorial](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2019/11/24/cost-benefit-analysis?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_261) by Peter Ellis shows how to perform cost-benefit analysis in R and how to build in uncertainty in a much clearer way than is generally done.

**How to apply machine/deep learning to audio analysis, with comet.ml** This [post](https://medium.com/comet-ml/applyingmachinelearningtoaudioanalysis-utm-source-kdnuggets11-19-e160b069e88) is focused on showing how data scientists and AI practitioners can use `comet.ml` to apply machine learning and deep learning methods in the domain of audio analysis. To understand how models can extract information from digital audio signals, we’ll dive into some of the core feature engineering methods for audio analysis.

**Collection of Jupyter notebooks for quantitative finance.** Nice collection on [github](https://github.com/cantaro86/Financial-Models-Numerical-Methods?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_261) of interactive notebooks about quantitative finance. It contains several topics that are not so popular nowadays, but that can be very powerful, e.g. PDE methods, Lévy processes, Fourier methods or Kalman filters. There's also a worthwhile discussion about this project and related resources on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21610687&utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_261). 

**Create a streetmap of your favorite city with ggplot2.** In this [tutorial](https://ggplot2tutor.com/streetmaps/streetmaps/?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_261), and its sources [here](https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2018/accessing-openstreetmap-data-with-r/) and [here](https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata), you'll learn how to create streetmaps for any city. We will use the packages osmdata and ggplot2. With osmdata we can extract the streets from the Openstreetmap database. Openstreetmap is a freely available database of all locations in the world under an open license. Therefore, we don't need an API key or the like to get the data.  

**Tutorial on Graph Neural Networks for Computer Vision and Beyond (in 3 parts).** I’m answering questions that AI/ML/CV people not familiar with graphs or graph neural networks typically ask. I provide PyTorch examples to clarify the idea behind this relatively new and exciting kind of model. [Part 1](https://medium.com/@BorisAKnyazev/tutorial-on-graph-neural-networks-for-computer-vision-and-beyond-part-1-3d9fada3b80d), [part 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/tutorial-on-graph-neural-networks-for-computer-vision-and-beyond-part-2-be6d71d70f49), [part 3](https://towardsdatascience.com/spectral-graph-convolution-explained-and-implemented-step-by-step-2e495b57f801).
