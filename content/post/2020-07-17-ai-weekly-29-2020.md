**Benchmarking Deep Learning Optimizers** [(arXiv:2007.01547)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01547). Choosing the optimizer is among the most crucial decisions of deep learning engineers, and it is not an easy one. The growing literature now lists literally hundreds of optimization methods. A group of researchers from TÃ¼bingen university has now systematically evaluated 14 popular optimization, using a [Deep Optimization Benchmark Suite](https://deepobs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/tutorial.html) they had [published](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05499) last year. While no particular method yielded the best performance in all problems, several popular ones worked well on the majority of problems, including Adam, which is often the default recommendation.
