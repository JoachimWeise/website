For a quite some time I had planned to build my own small mobile robot. During the last weeks I had gathered the components and played a little bit with an Arduino and ultrasonic distance sensors (as described in an [earlier post](/post/2019-12-25-ultrasonic-sensor-raspi/)). Now I have finally found the time to put the basic setup in place and go for a first test drive.

Before getting lost in potentially boring details, here's a video of the first test drive (turning on the spot). Note that the Raspberry is acting as video streaming server (see [here](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/recipes2.html#web-streaming) for documentation) so that the live transmission of this noteworthy event can be seen on the notebook in the back:

Now for some more background on the why and how of this activity. Back in the last century I had studied industrial engineering, with a focus on semiconductor physics and electronics. More than 20 years later I again wanted to do something practical that also nicely relates to the topic of AI. Thus came the idea to build a mobile robot as a simple AI system that (one day in the future) will be able to sense its environments, to reason, to pursue a plan, to act upon its environment, and to learn.

I selected the [Pirate-4WD Mobile Platform](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-97.html) as a chassis which is both inexpensive (at some 40 USD) and rock-solid thanks to its aluminum alloy body. Included in the set are 4 drive motors, 4 wheels, a battery holder and additional mounting hardware. I decided to control the DC motors with an [Arduino Uno Rev3](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3), a microcontroller that is specifically designed to interact with sensors, motors and all kinds of devices, in combination with an [Adafruit Motor Shield V2](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/overview). The motor shield is powered by a set of 5 NiMh rechargeable batteries which find their place in a battery holder in between the 4 motors.

The brain of the mobile bot currently is not the Arduino, but an older [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) that I had lying around. The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer that is about the size of a credit card. Despite its small size, it is a very capable device. The Pi runs versions of Linux that are customized to work on the ARM processor that drives it. This puts a lot of functionality into a small device that is easy to embed into things like robots. I have equipped the Pi 2 with a Wifi dongle so that I can wirelessly SSH into it. 

A USB cable connects Raspberry and Arduino (the massive blue cable which I will replace with a shorter one as quickly as possible), serving both as a power supply to the Arduino (but not the motor shield) and allowing to upload [Arduino sketches](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) (i.e., C/C++ like programs) from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino. The Raspberry Pi is powered through another USB cable from a powerbank that I again had lying around. 

In order to mount the powerbank and fix sensors I produced several parts from acrylic glass. Three ultrasonic sensors watch out for obstacles in front of the car, complemented by a Raspberry [PiCamera](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/index.html). Since the HC-SR04 circuit boards sport about the smallest drill holes I have ever seen, thereby rendering them useless for any practical purposes, I had to fix the sensor with elastic straps, which is certainly not elegant but does the job. I will connect them to the Raspberry Pi through voltage dividers ([see earlier post](/post/2019-12-25-ultrasonic-sensor-raspi/)) on the breadboard next to Pi on one of the upcoming weekends.
