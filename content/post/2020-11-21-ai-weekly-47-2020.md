**FinRL: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Library for Automated Stock Trading in Quantitative Finance.** This [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09607v1.pdf) introduces a DRL library FinRL that facilitates beginners to expose themselves to quantitative finance and to develop their own stock trading strategies. Along with easily-reproducible tutorials, FinRL library allows users to streamline their own developments and to compare with existing schemes easily. Within FinRL, virtual environments are configured with stock market datasets, trading agents are trained with neural networks, and extensive backtesting is analyzed via trading performance. Moreover, it incorporates important trading constraints such as transaction cost, market liquidity and the investorâ€™s degree of risk-aversion. FinRL is featured with completeness, hands-on tutorial and reproducibility that favors beginners. The library can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/FinRL-Library).
