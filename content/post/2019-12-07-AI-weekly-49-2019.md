## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say




## Tools, Frameworks, Code

**AWS launches SageMaker Studio, a web-based IDE for machine learning.** AWS has [announced the launch](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-studio-the-first-fully-integrated-development-environment-for-machine-learning/) of SageMaker Studio, a web-based IDE for building and training machine learning workflows. It includes everything a data scientist would need to get started, including ways to organize notebooks, data sets, code and models, for example. It essentially wants to be a one-stop shop for all the machine learning tools and results you need to get started. At the core of Studio is also the ability to share projects and folders with others who are working on the same project, including the ability to discuss notebooks and results. SageMaker Studio is integrated with AWS’s SageMaker machine learning service, which can automatically scale based on your needs. It now includes a debugger, a monitoring tool and Autopilot, which automatically creates the best models for you based on your data, with full visibility into how it decides to build your models. Related to this, AWS also launched SageMaker Notebooks, also integrated into Studio, as a managed service. Data scientists won’t have to provision instances for this as they will automatically provision them as necessary.
