## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say

 


## Tools and Frameworks

**The State of Machine Learning Frameworks in 2019.** An article by Horace He in [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/) analyzes the relative popularity of machine learning (more precisely: deep learning) frameworks. In 2019, the war for DL frameworks has two remaining main contenders: PyTorch and TensorFlow. The analysis suggests that researchers are abandoning TensorFlow and flocking to PyTorch in droves, with research papers using PyTorch at least twice as often as Tensorflow. Likely reasons are its ease of use, pythonic style, good integration with the Python ecosystem.  Meanwhile in industry, Tensorflow is currently the platform of choice, but that may not be true for long. Potential advantages of Tensorflow mentioned are its graph format, the fact that  the execution engine natively has no need for Python, and the fact that TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Serving address mobile and serving considerations respectively.
