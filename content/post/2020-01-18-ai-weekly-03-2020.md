**Apple has quietly acquired low-power AI startup Xnor.ai for about $200M.** According to several sources [cited by GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/exclusive-apple-acquires-xnor-ai-edge-ai-spin-paul-allens-ai2-price-200m-range/) and featured on [SiliconANGLE](https://siliconangle.com/2020/01/15/report-apple-quietly-acquired-low-power-ai-startup-xnor-ai-200m/), Apple has acquired Xnor.ai, a Seattle startup specializing in low-power, edge-based artificial intelligence tools, which began its life as a spinout from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The Allen Institute is a nonprofit research center based in Seattle that operates an in-house startup incubator. It launched 2014 with a $125 million grant from late Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen. Xnor.ai has developed a software platform that reduces the amount of power it takes to run machine learning models. It works by converting the mathematical calculations an AI algorithm uses to process data into binary operations, the simplest type of operation a processor can perform. Xnor.ai’s binary-based representation of a given mathematical problem thus takes fewer steps to execute than if it were described in standard code, which has the end result of improving power efficiently. The company notched several notable advances in 2019, including the development of a standalone AI chip capable of running for years on solar power or a coin-sized battery, the debut of an AI-enabled gizmo that can autonomously monitor grocery shelves. There are many ways Apple could put Xnor.ai’s technology and know-how to use. One obvious application is improving the power efficiency of the system-on-chips inside the iPhone and iPad, which have machine learning accelerators to boost application performance.



## Publications

**Up to two billion times acceleration of scientific simulations
with deep neural architecture search** [(arXiv:2001.08055)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08055.pdf). Quote: "Computer simulations are invaluable tools for scientific discovery. However, accurate simulations are often slow to execute, which limits their applicability to extensive parameter exploration, largescale data analysis, and uncertainty quantification. A promising route to accelerate simulations by building fast emulators with machine learning requires large training datasets, which can be prohibitively expensive to obtain with slow simulations. Here we present a method based on neural architecture search to build accurate emulators even with a limited number of training data. The method successfully accelerates simulations by up to 2 billion times in 10 scientific cases including astrophysics, climate science, biogeochemistry, high energy density physics, fusion energy, and seismology, using the same super-architecture, algorithm, and hyperparameters. Our approach also
inherently provides emulator uncertainty estimation, adding further confidence in their use." 

**Researchers propose system that taps AI to see hidden objects around corners.** Can sensors see behind the corners of obstacles in real time? As it turns out, yes. A study by researchers at Stanford, Rice University, Princeton, and Southern Methodist University [published in the journal Optica](https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-7-1-63) proposes a system that’s capable of producing around-the-bend images at high resolutions and speeds. Quote from the abstract: "We use spectral estimation theory to derive a noise model for NLoS (non-line-of-sight) correlography. We use this model to develop a speckle correlation-based technique for recovering occluded objects from indirect reflections. Then, using only synthetic data sampled from the proposed noise model, and without knowledge of the experimental scenes nor their geometry, we train a deep convolutional neural network to solve the noisy phase retrieval problem associated with correlography."
