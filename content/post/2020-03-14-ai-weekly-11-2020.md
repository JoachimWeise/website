**Satellites and AI Monitor Chinese Economy’s Reaction to Coronavirus.** As reported in [IEEE spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/satellites-and-ai-monitor-chinese-economys-reaction-to-coronavirus), researchers at WeBank mine satellite, GPS, and social media data to conclude that the Chinese economy is well on the way to recovering from COVID-19. [WeBank](https://www.webank.com/),  China's 1st digital bank initiated by Tencent, offers wealth management and financing services through different online platforms. WeBank’s AI Moonshot Team has taken the deep learning system SolarNet developed to [detect solar panel installations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03685) from satellite imagery and repurposed it to track China’s economic recovery from the novel coronavirus outbreak. They looked at heat signatures from steel mills and correlated the results with steel output. In late January, at the height of the outbreak, China’s steel production had dropped to 30 percent of capacity, they found. By February 9, it had recovered to 76 percent. Using other models they looked at GPS signals from commuters and social media posts on home office work.

**AlphaGo - The Movie | Full Documentary.** With more board configurations than there are atoms in the universe, the ancient Chinese game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. To celebrate the landmark anniversary, DeepMind is releasing [AlphaGo - The Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) on YouTube.
