**Personalizing the Joke Skill of a Voice-Controlled Virtual Assistant** ([arXiv:1912.03234v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03234)). Two researchers from Amazon, Seattle, describe methods used to improve the joke skill of Voice-controlled virtual assistants (VVA) through personalization. VVA depend to a good part on the emotional and personalized experience they deliver, with humor being a key component in providing an engaging interaction. They present several methods, both traditional NLP techniques as well as deep learning based models. Online A/B tests show that the NLP-based model consistently outperforms heuristic methods. Offline results suggest further improvements from DL-approaches, but at the cost of added complexity and latency.
