**Google Research: Looking Back at 2019, and Forward to 2020 and Beyond.** A rare [post by Jeff Dean](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/google-research-looking-back-at-2019.html), Senior Fellow and SVP of Google Research and Health, on behalf of the entire Google Research community. In his look back, he provides links to plenty of Google achievements and publications in areas such as ethical AI, AI for social good, applications to various fields of science, AI in mobile phones, applications to healthcare, quantum computing, ML algos, AutoML, NLP, and machine perception. The breadth of topics and publications is simply overwhelming. In his look forward to 2020 and beyond, Jeff Dean mentions the following topics (1) Redesigning computing platforms with specialized TPUs for inference and others for training-and-inference, (2) building machine learning systems that can handle millions of tasks, and that can learn to successfully accomplish new tasks automatically, (3) avoiding bias, increasing interpretability & understandability, improving privacy and ensuring safety, (4) applying computation and machine learning to make advances in important new areas of science, and (5) ensuring diversity in the research communities.
