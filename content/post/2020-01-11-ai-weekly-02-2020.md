## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say


 


## Tools and Frameworks

**Lyft releases Flyte, a platform for maintaining AI workflows.** [Lyft has announced](https://eng.lyft.com/introducing-flyte-cloud-native-machine-learning-and-data-processing-platform-fb2bb3046a59) the open sourcing of Flyte, a structured programming and distributed processing platform for highly concurrent, scalable, and maintainable workflows. Flyte has been serving production model training and data processing at Lyft for over three years now, becoming the de-facto platform for teams like Pricing, Locations, Estimated Time of Arrivals (ETA), Mapping, Self-Driving (L5), and more. In fact, Flyte manages over 7,000 unique workflows at Lyft, totaling over 100,000 executions every month, 1 million tasks, and 10 million containers. Workflows are often composed of heterogeneous steps. One step, for example, might use Spark to prepare data, while the next uses this data to train a deep learning model. Each step can be written in a different language and utilize different frameworks. Flyte supports heterogeneity by having container images bound to a task. They can be anything from a single container execution, to a remote query in a Hive cluster, to a distributed Spark execution. When fine-grained control is desirable on the execution semantics of a task, Flyte provides backend plugins. These can be used to create and manage Kubernetes resources, including CRDs like Spark-on-k8s, or any remote system like Amazon Sagemaker, Qubole, BigQuery, and more. [Code](https://github.com/lyft/flyte) and [documentation](https://lyft.github.io/flyte/) can be found on github.
 


## Business News and Applications





## Publications

**Google Research: Looking Back at 2019, and Forward to 2020 and Beyond.** A rare [post by Jeff Dean](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/google-research-looking-back-at-2019.html), Senior Fellow and SVP of Google Research and Health, on behalf of the entire Google Research community. In his look back, he provides links to plenty of Google achievements and publications in areas such as ethical AI, AI for social good, applications to various fields of science, AI in mobile phones, applications to healthcare, quantum computing, ML algos, AutoML, NLP, and machine perception. The breadth of topics and publications is simply overwhelming. In his look forward to 2020 and beyond, Jeff Dean mentions the following topics (1) Redesigning computing platforms with specialized TPUs for inference and others for training-and-inference, (2) building machine learning systems that can handle millions of tasks, and that can learn to successfully accomplish new tasks automatically, (3) avoiding bias, increasing interpretability & understandability, improving privacy and ensuring safety, (4) applying computation and machine learning to make advances in important new areas of science, and (5) ensuring diversity in the research communities.

**An Idea From Physics Helps AI See in Higher Dimensions.** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved surprisingly adept at learning patterns in two-dimensional data — especially in computer vision tasks like recognizing handwritten words and objects in digital images. But when applied to data sets without a built-in planar geometry — say, models of irregular shapes used in 3D computer animation, or the point clouds generated by self-driving cars to map their surroundings — this powerful machine learning architecture doesn’t work well. Around 2016, a new discipline called geometric deep learning emerged with the goal of lifting CNNs out of flatland. Already, so-called gauge CNNs have greatly outperformed their predecessors in learning patterns in simulated global climate data, which is naturally mapped onto a sphere. Technical details may be found in a preprint on [arXiv:1902.04615](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04615.pdf), but the topic is also featured in [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/an-idea-from-physics-helps-ai-see-in-higher-dimensions-20200109/) in a less technical manner.
