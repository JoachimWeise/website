## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say




## Tools, Frameworks, Code

**Microsoft’s Vision AI Developer Kit is now generally available.** The Vision AI Developer Kit, a hardware base built on Qualcomm’s Vision Intelligence Platform designed to run AI models locally and integrate with Microsoft’s Azure ML and Azure IoT Edge cloud services. Microsoft and Qualcomm now [announced](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-and-qualcomm-accelerate-ai-with-vision-ai-developer-kit/) that the [Vision AI Developer Kit](https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/03/microsofts-vision-ai-developer-kit-is-now-generally-available/) (made by eInfochips) is now broadly available from distributor Arrow Electronics for $249. A software development kit containing Visual Studio Code with Python modules, prebuilt Azure IoT deployment configurations, and a Vision AI Developer Kit extension for Visual Studio is on GitHub, along with a default module that recognizes upwards of 183 different objects. The Vision AI Developer Kit has a rival in Amazon’s [AWS DeepLens](https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/29/amazon-unveils-deeplens-a-249-camera-for-deep-learning/) and the [Google Coral Dev Board](https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/06/google-begins-selling-the-150-coral-dev-board-a-hardware-kit-for-accelerated-ai-edge-computing/).




## Business News and Applications

**Intel unleashes three new chips for AI work, challenging Nvidia.** Intel introduced a trio of chips for training and deploying artificial intelligence models that will allow it to step up the competition against Nvidia, whose graphics processing units dominate the market. The chips grew out of Intel’s 2016 acquisitions of two machine learning companies, Nervana Systems and Movidius Ltd.

**Nasdaq is testing a deep learning system to monitor trading.** 
For the first time, [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/for-the-first-time-nasdaq-is-using-artificial-intelligence-to-surveil-u.s.-stock-market) is applying artificial intelligence on its U.S. stock market to detect irregular and potentially malicious trading activity. The newly launched initiative aims to strengthen and revolutionize market surveillance through deep learning, transfer learning and human-in-the-loop learning.


## Publications

**Neuroevolution: Evolve a New Path Toward Human Intelligence.** Neuroevolution, which combines neural networks with ideas drawn from Darwin, is gaining momentum. Its advocates claim that they can achieve faster, better results by generating a succession of new models, each slightly different than its predecessors, rather than relying on a purpose-built model. [Quanta magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computers-evolve-a-new-path-toward-human-intelligence-20191106/) surveys the field, focusing on neuroevolution pioneer and Uber senior researcher Kenneth Stanley.

## Tutorials

**[GitHub] huseinzol05/NLP-Models-Tensorflow.** An extensive [list of NLP models](https://github.com/huseinzol05/NLP-Models-Tensorflow) implemented in TensorFlow. Gathers machine learning and tensorflow deep learning models for some 20+ NLP problems, arranged in Jupyter Notebooks. 

**Data Science is Boring.** Many people cherrypick the exciting parts of doing Data Science (or ML, Machine Learning) to motivate themselves and others. But we must face a reality: the real work is often “boring” — boring as comparing to what people romanticize. Feeling bored creates tension; it, ultimately, leads to a high turnover rate in data science. [I want to share](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-is-boring-1d43473e353e) what I actually do and how I cope with the “boringness in data science”. I hope to help you, the aspiring Data Scientists, to set the right expectations.
