**The Decade of Deep Learning.** Driven by the development of ever-more powerful compute and the increased availability of big data, deep learning has seen monumental progress over the last decade and successfully tackled many previously intractable problems, especially in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. [This post](https://leogao.dev/2019/12/31/The-Decade-of-Deep-Learning/) is an overview of some the most influential Deep Learning papers of the last decade. It should provide a jumping-off point into many disparate areas of Deep Learning by providing succinct and dense summaries that go slightly deeper than a surface level exposition, with many references to the relevant resources.


**Using Machine Learning to “Nowcast” Precipitation in High Resolution.** Accurate weather predictions can be particularly challenging for localized storms or events that evolve on hourly timescales, such as thunderstorms. In the preprint [arXiv:1912.12132](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12132),  Google AI is presenting new research into the development of machine learning models for precipitation forecasting that addresses this challenge by making highly localized “physics-free” predictions that apply to the immediate future. A significant advantage of machine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an already-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in the native high resolution of the input data. This precipitation nowcasting, which focuses on 0-6 hour forecasts, can generate forecasts that have a 1km resolution with a total latency of just 5-10 minutes, including data collection delays, outperforming traditional models, even at these early stages of development.


## Tutorials

**Catalog of Variable Transformations To Make Your Model Work Better.** This [post on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/catalog-of-variable-transformations-to-make-your-model-works-better-7b506bf80b97) presents 10+ numeric variable transformation techniques and 7 categorical variable techniques, from basic approaches to advanced approaches. Though some are known to work better than others, e.g. target encoding has great track records than other encoding techniques, there’s not a single approach that always works well in every model with any data. Therefore, it is important to research well what encoding works best in what case, and when you face a new problem, you use as many approaches as introduced in this post until you figure out which works the best.
