I'm usually writing my notes on physics and mathematics, e.g. the ongoing series of posts on Riemannian geometry, in $$\LaTeX$$ documents, as probably most people do. For the purpose of this blog I regularly need to convert parts of these documents into markdown that Hugo can understand. Since I haven't found any better solution yet I decided to develop a set of regular expressions in Python that do the job pretty well. I normally run the code in a Jupyter notebook that allows me to check the quality of conversion immediately and do some minor tweaking if required.

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world. The Python module `re` provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”. You can also use regular expressions to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways. Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C.

The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not all possible string processing tasks can be done using regular expressions. There are also tasks that can be done with regular expressions, but the expressions turn out to be very complicated. In these cases, you may be better off writing Python code to do the processing; while Python code will be slower than an elaborate regular expression, it will also probably be more understandable. However, many websites help explain how regexes work. I specially like [regexr.com](regexr.com) where you can interactively play with regexes, watch their effect on a sample string and receive insights by pressing the .  

Basically the only regex task I am using is to find all the matches for a pattern, and replace them with a different string. The `sub()` method takes a replacement value, which can be either a string or a function, and the string to be processed:
    re.sub(replacement, string[, count=0])
It returns the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of the regex in `string` by the replacement `replacement`. If the pattern isn’t found, `string` is returned unchanged. The optional argument `count` is the maximum number of pattern occurrences to be replaced; `count` must be a non-negative integer. The default value of 0 means to replace all occurrences.
