## Breakthrough &mdash; Or So They Say

 


## Tools and Frameworks

**Open Sourcing Amundsen: A Data Discovery And Metadata Platform.** In order to increase productivity of their data scientists and research scientists, [Lyft](https://eng.lyft.com/) has developed a data discovery application built on top of a metadata engine. Now, [Amundsen](https://eng.lyft.com/open-sourcing-amundsen-a-data-discovery-and-metadata-platform-2282bb436234) has been open-sourced and can be found on [github](https://github.com/lyft/amundsen). Amundsen follows a micro-service architecture and is comprised of five major components: (1) Metadata Service handles metadata requests from the front-end service as well as other micro services. By default the persistent layer is Neo4j, but can be substituted. (2) Search Service is backed by Elasticsearch to handle search requests from the front-end service. By default the search engine is powered by ElasticSearch, but can be substituted. (3) Front-End Service hosts Amundsenâ€™s web application. (4) Databuilder is a generic data ingestion framework which extracts metadata from various sources.
(5) Common is a library repo which holds common codes among all micro services in Amundsen.
