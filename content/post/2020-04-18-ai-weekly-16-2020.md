**Forecasting Best Practices, from Microsoft.** Microsoft has released a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/forecasting) to share best practices for time series forecasting. From the repo: "This repository provides examples and best practice guidelines for building forecasting solutions. The goal of this repository is to build a comprehensive set of tools and examples that leverage recent advances in forecasting algorithms to build solutions and operationalize them. Rather than creating implementations from scratch, we draw from existing state-of-the-art libraries and build additional utilities around processing and featurizing the data, optimizing and evaluating models, and scaling up to the cloud. The repository includes detailed examples of various time series modeling techniques, as Jupyter Notebooks for Python, and R Markdown documents for R. [...] Currently, we focus on a retail sales forecasting use case as it is widely used in assortment planning, inventory optimization, and price optimization. To enable high-throughput forecasting scenarios, we have included examples for forecasting multiple time series with distributed training techniques such as Ray in Python, parallel package in R, and multi-threading in LightGBM." Featured models currently include Auto ARIMA, Linear Regression, LightGBM, DilatedCNN, Mean Forecast, ARIMA, ETS, Prophet.
