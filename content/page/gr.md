### Mathematics of Curved Spacetime

[Differentiable Manifolds](/post/2020-01-12-differential-manifolds/): Defining an abstract manifold as a space consisting of patches that look locally like the Euclidean space and are smoothly sewn together. Introducing functions and curves on manifolds.

[Tangent Spaces](/post/2020-03-01-tangent-space/): Defining tangent vectors as derivations, or directional derivative operators acting on functions along curves. The set of tangent vectors a point $$p$$ of a manifold has the structure of a vector space under addition and scalar multiplication.
