### The Basics

[Basic setup using Arduino and Raspberry Pi](/post/2020-01-26-robot/): Describing the basic construction of the bot, using Pirate-4WD Mobile Platform, Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno.

[Ultrasonic Range Sensor on the Raspberry Pi](/post/2019-12-25-ultrasonic-sensor-raspi/): Interfacing the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor module with a Raspberry Pi to measure distance. Using an oscilloscope to dive a little deeper into the inner workings of the sensor.

[Remote Development on Raspberry and Arduino with VS Code](/post/2020-04-07-vscode-remote/): Short note on how to use Visual Studio Code to do remote development on a Raspberry Pi and even push Arduino sketches from the Raspberry console to an Arduino without touching the Arduino IDE.

[Arduino Motor Control Using Serial Connection](/post/2020-05-17-serial-connection/): Establishing bidirectional serial communication between the Raspberry Pi, acting as *spiritus rector*, and the Arduino, translating abstract intention into concrete motor control with the Adafruit Motor Shield.
